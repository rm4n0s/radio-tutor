# Manual checks

Checks that need a person (a real display, real sound, a phone, a provider). Each item has the step id and the exact commands. When you have done one, tell the assistant the result; it is recorded in the step's entry in `docs/IMPLEMENTED.md` and the item is removed.

## 6.1 App shell and login

Both checks use throw-away data folders (`scripts/isolated.sh`), never your real ones.

1. **First run, login and the Greek UI on a real display.**
   `scripts/isolated.sh -- go run ./cmd/radio-tutor`
   Create the parent account, log out, switch EN / ΕΛ on the login screen, log in again. Does every Greek text show real letters (no empty boxes), and does the window feel right (buttons easy to hit, nothing cut off at 800x600)? Close the window with the close button.
2. **Second instance.** In one terminal, with throw-away folders shared by both runs:
   `export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$(mktemp -d) XDG_DATA_HOME=$(mktemp -d) XDG_STATE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) XDG_CACHE_HOME=$(mktemp -d)`
   `go run ./cmd/radio-tutor &`
   `go run ./cmd/radio-tutor; echo "exit $?"`
   The second run shows a small window "Radio Tutor is already running"; OK closes it, and the terminal prints "Radio Tutor is already running" and `exit 2`. Then close the first window and check that `jobs` shows nothing left.
